# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2
## Issues
### Setup
I had some issues with setting up the project, after downloading the provided .zip-file. I was trying to get it to work in Intellij, but I had to setup some extra configuration in Intellij to make sure I could see the created database.
After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB2uSJX7jnM) tutorial I got an understanding on how to view my db in Intellij.
### Lombok
After getting the database to work, I had some issues with setting up lombok in Intellij, because it couldn't find the maven dependency.
Fixed it by enabling annotation processing, then rebuilding the project (also restarted the IDE).

### Experiment 2
I had to do some more research into mapping the relationship correctly and what extra things to provide (like 'mappedBy').

## code
[Link to the code](https://github.com/arne-sas/dat250_1/tree/main/code/Assignment_2)

I inspected the database by providing the credentials into the database window in Intellij, this way I could easily check whether the information was present in the database or not.
